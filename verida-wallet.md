# Verida Wallet

The Verida Wallet is a mobile application that acts as both a “Data Wallet” and a “Crypto Wallet” for end users. It provides private key management and a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Verida network and supported blockchains.

The Verida Wallet provides users with the following core capabilities:

* **Identity:** Allows users to create new decentralized identities, blockchain wallets, manage their private keys and facilitate authentication across an ecosystem of decentralized apps.
* **Single sign-on:** Simple, consensual authentication and authorization with decentralized applications developed on the Verida network.
* **User Data:** Allows users to browse their decrypted data, consensually share their data, allow it to be queried without sharing or move their data to a different storage service.
* **Inbox:** A secure data inbox allows messages, requests and data to be received by end users and then actioned.
* **Profiles:** Users can create and manage both public and private profiles that can be shared with third parties.
* **Tokens and Transactions:** Users can interact with any supported blockchain by signing transactions, transferring assets, managing NFTs etc. Users can also earn Verida token rewards by simply using the network.
