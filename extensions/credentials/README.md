# Credentials

## Introduction[â€‹](https://developers.verida.network/docs/extensions/credentials/verifiable-credentials#introduction) <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Verifiable Credentials are a [W3C standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) that is supported within the Verida network with the [@verida/verifiable-credential](https://npmjs.com/@verida/verifiable-credentials) npm package.

Verida has a demonstration implementation of verifiable credentials. We expect to support other credential libraries and protocols in the future.

Verifiable Credentials can be issued by an account on the Verida Network. The credentials can be privately or publicly stored by a Verida Account on the Verida Network. They can be verified by anyone, using the Verida Verifiable Credentials library (`@verida/verifiable-credential`).
