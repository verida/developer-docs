# Decentralized Identity

Decentralized Identifiers are a [W3C standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and core to user identities using the Verida Network. The Verida network enables userâ€™s to maintain private keys/seed phrases to control their identity.

Each decentralized identity is an account on the Verida Network.

Users control the private keys to their accounts, enabling them to:

* Encrypt, authenticate and authorize access to their private data
* Control where their data is stored
* Sign their data and messages to third parties
* Send and receive encrypted messages with other identities
* Sign into decentralized applications

Verida has implemented a fast, low cost implemention of the DID Core standard that forms the basis of accounts on the Verida Network. [Learn more](https://news.verida.network/introducing-did-vda-a-fast-cheap-web3-identity-solution-on-polygon-5d1487941477).
