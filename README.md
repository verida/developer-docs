# Welcome

**Verida is the confidential database storage and compute layer for the self-sovereign data economy.**

We believe itâ€™s a fundamental human right that individuals have ownership and control over their data. We believe everyone has a right to control their identity through decentralization, giving netizens control and self-sovereignty over how they interact with the digital world.

The Verida Network is a multi-chain protocol for interoperable confidential database storage, confidential compute and messaging network built on decentralized identity standards where data is owned and controlled by users.

Users can install the [verida-vault.md](private-data-bridge/verida-vault.md "mention") (and coming soon, sign up to the [verida-vault.md](private-data-bridge/verida-vault.md "mention")) to create a Verida account and manage their private data.

Developers can connect to the [Verida APIs](apis/private-data-apis.md) or integrate the [Verida SDK](protocol/client-sdk/) into applications to facilitate:

* Adding private user data storage to existing applications
* Accessing AI agents and prompts that have access to user data
* Accessing user data to create AI agents, Data marketplaces, Research, Marketing etc.
* Bridging user data to blockchain smart contracts

## Getting Started <a href="#getting-started" id="getting-started"></a>

You will need to download the Verida Wallet to create a decentralized identity on the Verida Network. This ensures your private key remains on your mobile device and is kept secure.

{% hint style="info" %}
Alternative account creation methods will be released in Q4 2024 (ie: Sign in with Ethereum, Sign in with Email, Sign in with Google / Apple / Facebook etc.)
{% endhint %}
