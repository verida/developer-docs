# Welcome

{% hint style="info" %}
This is the Verida Network Documentation.

You may be looking for [Verida AI documentation](https://docs.verida.ai/) for using Verida API's.
{% endhint %}

**Verida is the confidential database storage and compute layer for the self-sovereign data economy.**

Users can extract and store personal data from centralized platforms like Google, Telegram, Slack, and LinkedIn, using the Verida Private Data Bridge, and store it in user-controlled encrypted vaults on the Verida network.&#x20;

The network offers secure, off-chain encrypted storage for users to own and control their data, enabling safe, hyper-personalized AI experiences with this contextual data.&#x20;

Veridaâ€™s confidential compute network ensures that this encrypted data integrates with AI models while preserving privacy and protecting user data from model owners.

Users can install the [verida-wallet.md](verida-wallet.md "mention") to create a Verida account and manage their private data.

Developers can connect to the [Verida API's](https://docs.verida.ai/) or integrate the [Verida SDK](protocol/client-sdk/) into applications to facilitate:

* Adding private user data storage to existing applications
* Accessing AI agents and prompts that have access to user data
* Accessing user data to create AI agents, Data marketplaces, Research, Marketing etc.
