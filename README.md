# Welcome

**Verida is the confidential database storage and compute layer for the self-sovereign data economy.**

Users can extract personal data from centralized platforms like Google, Telegram, Slack, and LinkedIn, using the Verida Private Data Bridge, and store it in user-controlled encrypted vaults on the Verida network.&#x20;

The network offers secure, off-chain encrypted storage for users to own and control their data, enabling safe, hyper-personalized AI experiences with this contextual data.&#x20;

Veridaâ€™s confidential compute network ensures that this encrypted data integrates with AI models while preserving privacy and protecting user data from model owners.

Users can install the [verida-vault.md](private-data-bridge/verida-vault.md "mention") (and coming soon, sign up to the [verida-vault.md](private-data-bridge/verida-vault.md "mention")) to create a Verida account and manage their private data.

Developers can connect to the [Verida APIs](apis/private-data-apis.md) or integrate the [Verida SDK](protocol/client-sdk/) into applications to facilitate:

* Adding private user data storage to existing applications
* Accessing AI agents and prompts that have access to user data
* Accessing user data to create AI agents, Data marketplaces, Research, Marketing etc.
* Bridging user data to blockchain smart contracts

## Getting Started <a href="#getting-started" id="getting-started"></a>

You will need to download the Verida Wallet to create a decentralized identity on the Verida Network. This ensures your private key remains on your mobile device and is kept secure.

{% hint style="info" %}
Alternative account creation methods will be released in Q4 2024 (ie: Sign in with Ethereum, Sign in with Email, Sign in with Google / Apple / Facebook etc.)
{% endhint %}
